Education policy: Navigating new challenges and demands\n\n\nSection 2: The governance of education quasi-markets. Policy tensions and regulatory challenges\n\nCall for papersSubmissionContactOn IWPP 2026On the workshop\n\n\nAcross a growing number of countries, education services are delivered through quasi-market arrangements where public and private subsidised provision coexist and user choice plays a central role. In some contexts, mixed-provision schemes can be traced back to the creation of modern education systems, as the establishment of public systems of schooling did not necessarily entail the dismantling of private provision but often gave rise to some form of subsidisation (Ansell & Lindvall, 2021). In other countries, private subsidised enrolment has expanded considerably over the last decades in light of contemporary policy developments – most notably, the advent of market reforms. The expansion of user choice is a more recent but equally widespread phenomenon. Paralleling a decline in the role of residence in student-allocation processes, school-choice opportunities for parents have tended to increase, with most education systems allowing today for some degree of freedom of school choice (Musset, 2012; OECD, 2019).\nYet, despite the entrenched nature of education quasi-markets, recent years have been marked by an increase in their plurality and complexity. Alongside the diversification of the forms these arrangements take, expectations regarding the public and private interests they serve have also changed. Hence, while private subsidised providers have historically been expected to preserve a degree of privateness requiring certain autonomy and differentiation, such providers are increasingly expected to align with system-level goals and variously defined public interests, especially regarding equity objectives. Likewise, school-choice systems are increasingly expected to reconcile parental freedom with equity objectives, requiring some form of State intervention in student allocation (Zancajo et al., 2023).\nThis workshop is concerned with the tensions inherent in the coexistence of competing demands and expectations within contemporary education quasi-markets, particularly regarding the interplay between public and private forms of provision and spheres of interest. It builds on the premise that such diversity of expectations fundamentally constitutes a public policy challenge requiring an understanding of the varied origins of education quasi-market arrangements and the policy instruments underpinning them, as well as of the policy design choices through which different actors seek to govern and reform existing configurations. Accordingly, the workshop aims at facilitating a discussion along four venues of inquiry:\n\nWhat are the conceptualisation and operationalisation challenges posed by the public and private provision categories in education? Particular attention will be given to how different definitions and measurements help capture and interpret the tensions posed by contemporary education quasi-markets.\nHow do mixed provision and school choice arrangements vary across contexts and over time, and what specific governance challenges stem from such different policy configurations? The workshop will examine the policy dilemmas associated with different institutional settlements between providers, families, and governments.\nWhat regulatory approaches and policy instruments are used in different contexts to address emerging policy challenges? The workshop will pay particular attention to agenda-setting, policy formulation and policy implementation processes, examining how such dynamics shape the outcomes and impacts of different policy choices.\nWhat values and political rationales underpin current policy debates around private provision and choice in education? The workshop will address how competing notions of social justice are negotiated in ongoing policy processes, and how such normative considerations influence the legitimacy and impact of reforms.\n\nThe workshop aims at stimulating a debate on the challenges posed by the study of education quasi-markets from a public policy perspective, bringing together researchers working across various contexts and stages of the policy cycle. We invite conceptual, empirical and methodological contributions. Empirical papers employing quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method approaches are welcome, including case studies and comparative analyses.\nListed references\nAnsell, B.W., & Lindvall, J. (2021).

Such tensions call for analytical attention as to the policy ideas and instruments through which education stakeholders mediate among different goals and address interrelated challenges – as well as on the impacts of such arrangements from a social justice and equity perspective. To this end, the workshop is organised into two separate sections, each examining such tensions from a different angle. The first section will address the policy challenges derived from the combination of crises affecting the education field; while the second section will focus on the governance and regulation of education quasi-markets.\nA detailed description of the workshop can be found in the IWPP 2026 website."
